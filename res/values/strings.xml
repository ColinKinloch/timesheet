        <b>Welcome to Timesheet!</b>  To start, add some tasks to Timesheet.
        Tasks can be billable tasks such as "Project Documentation" or
        unbillable tasks such as "Lunch".  Use the "Add Task" menu 
        option to add a task.\n
        \n
        After tasks have been added, click on a task to select it as
        the current task.  The checkbox shows which task you are 
        currently working on.  Selecting a new task will close out
        the current one and start the new task.  Selecting the 
        current task will close it out without starting a new one.\n
        \n
        To get a report of hours, use the "Time List" menu option to
        get a report of time by day or by week.\n
